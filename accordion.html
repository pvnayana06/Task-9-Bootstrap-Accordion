                        <p>Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan constituted a committee in the year 1994 to suggest a specific action plan with a view to further strengthen primary education. This committee made some recommendations regarding streamlining the teaching work and learning based on activities. Accordingly, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan adopted an activity based method of teaching at the primary level and grade system was introduced for evaluating the performance of children. The objective of assessment is to improve the abilities of the child rather than keeping him in the same class. A 6-week school readiness program has been designed to provide a home-like environment to the students in primary classes and to make learning more interesting. At the end of the program, with the aim of evaluating the success of the desired goal, assessment is made by the teacher regarding the following points:-</p>
